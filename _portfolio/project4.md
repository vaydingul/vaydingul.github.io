A minimalist tensor library written in C++ to perform basic tensor operations. It is created to be used in another deep-learning-from-scratch *(work in progress)* project in C++. Library allows you to create tensors of arbitrary dimension and perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and element-wise operations. It also allows you to perform matrix multiplication and transpose operations.
