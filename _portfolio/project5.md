Below, you can find a list of the computational physics projects that I have worked on. [This](https://github.com/vaydingul/PHYS514-Problem_Sets) repository contains the weekly homeworks that I have done during the computational physics course I've taken in Koc University. You can find the relevant topics in the repository. 

[This](https://github.com/vaydingul/PHYS514_Project) repository contains a project that investigates the *White Dwarf* data and makes analysis related to white dwarf emergence and transitions.
