During my time in [Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory](https://rml.ku.edu.tr/), I designed two different projects to control experimental setups that we have constructed. [First](https://github.com/vaydingul/Surface_Haptics_Setup) one is to control a very complex structure which includes two linear stages, high resolution camera, and data acquisition devices (DAQs). 

[TacTX](https://github.com/vaydingul/TacTX) is another project that I designed to control a surface haptics setup. It includes a capacitive touch screen, a force sensor, an accelerometer, and a DAQ device that is responsible for whole data acquisition. TacTX is not only a suite that controls an electromechanical setup but also it provides you a framework to work with any DAQ device in MATLAB.
