    title: "About Me"
    text: "Engineer, programmer, researcher, and a dreamer."
    body: "Currently, I am a computer vision researcher working with [**Asst. Prof. Fatma Guney**](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/) in **Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)**. I am working on the **model-based policy learning for urban driving**. I am especially interested in generating a framework that allows reasoning about the optimal action by predicting the future (i.e., world models). Previously, I worked in [**Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory (RML)**](https://rml.ku.edu.tr/) with [**Prof. Dr. Cagatay Basdogan**](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~cbasdogan/). My work in RML mainly focused on the generation of proper signals to convey tactile feeling to high-end consumer electronics with touch screen (i.e., [**surface haptics**](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/research/topics/surface-haptic-technology-development/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSurface%20haptics%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20creation,shear%20force%20at%20each%20fingertip.)).<br> <br> I took my BSc. degree from [**Middle East Technical University (METU)**](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in [**Aerospace Engineering**](http://ae.metu.edu.tr/). I specialized in control, dynamic modelling, and simulation during my undergraduate studies. Currently, I am conducting my graduate studies in **Computational Science and Engineering** department at [**Koc University**](https://www.ku.edu.tr/). In Koc University, I am also awarded with [**Koc University Is Bank (KUIS) Artificial Intelligence Fellowship**](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/)."
